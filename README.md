## QC Analysis
This folder contains artifacts of two projects completed in Spring of 2022. The first is an automated email weekly to a Program Manager outlining emerging issues in their state. 
The second is a multi-query job to populate a Google Data Studio dashboard for a team of National Data staff overseeing projects in 10 states. At a glance, I wanted to be able to tell who needed coaching and/or technical support.

## Voter File Cleanup
For this task, I was asked to stitch together several large files of voter records using R and export them in a single cleaned file, assuring there were no duplicates within.
