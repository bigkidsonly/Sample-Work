## QC Analysis
This folder contains artifacts of two projects completed in Spring of 2022. The first is an automated email weekly to a Program Manager outlining emerging issues in their state. 
The second is a multi-query job to populate a Google Data Studio dashboard for a team of National Data staff overseeing projects in 10 states. At a glance, we wanted to be able to tell who needed coaching and/or technical support.

## Data Manager Scripting Task
This is part of a job application package where I was asked to complete two tasks: join and check large sets of voter records using R. The second task is a campaign strategy short response.
